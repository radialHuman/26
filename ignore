**Finally. The actual question.**

Not "what's wrong" or "why" or "what to do."

**How do you find the people?**

---

## **THE HONEST ANSWER:**

**I don't know a reliable method.**

But here's what I can piece together from what exists:

---

## **WHERE PEOPLE WHO SEE THIS MIGHT BE:**

**1. INTENTIONAL COMMUNITIES (already trying)**

**Resources:**
- **ic.org** (Intentional Communities directory)
  - Lists ecovillages, communes, cohousing
  - Can filter by values, location
  - Some accept visitors/work-traders
  
- **wwoof.net** (World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms)
  - Work on farms globally
  - Meet people living more directly
  - Test if you can actually do the work
  
- **workaway.info** / **helpx.net**
  - Similar to WWOOF, broader
  - Live/work exchanges
  - Meet people, see how they live

- **The Farm** (Tennessee)
- **Twin Oaks** (Virginia)
- **Findhorn** (Scotland)
- **Dancing Rabbit** (Missouri)
- Search: ecovillages near you

**Warning:** Many are middle-class hobby farms, not serious. Visit before committing.

---

**2. TRANSITION TOWNS / PERMACULTURE NETWORKS**

**Resources:**
- **transitionnetwork.org**
  - Local resilience groups
  - Preparing for energy descent
  - Real skills being learned

- **Permaculture courses** (PDC - Permaculture Design Certificate)
  - 2-week intensive courses
  - Meet people learning practical skills
  - Often at intentional communities

- Local permaculture guilds
- Resilience circles
- Community gardens

**Warning:** Some are performative middle-class greenwashing. Look for people actually building food systems, not just talking.

---

**3. SURVIVAL/PREPAREDNESS COMMUNITIES**

**Resources:**
- Bushcraft schools
- Wilderness survival courses
- Homesteading workshops
- Traditional skills gatherings

**Places:**
- **BOSS (Boulder Outdoor Survival School)**
- **Jack Mountain Bushcraft School**
- **Primitive skills gatherings** (search your region)

**Warning:** Some are right-wing preppers/militias. Some are liberal hippies. Some are serious. Discernment required.

---

**4. RELIGIOUS/TRADITIONAL COMMUNITIES**

**Options:**
- **Monasteries** (Buddhist, Christian, others)
  - Many accept visitors/residents
  - Built-in community structure
  - Established practices for living together

- **Anabaptist communities** (Mennonite, Bruderhof)
  - Some more open than Amish
  - Communal living, mutual aid

- **Catholic Worker houses**
  - Radical hospitality, simple living
  - Urban and rural

- **Buddhist practice communities**
  - Plum Village tradition
  - Insight Meditation Society
  - Various monasteries

**Warning:** Comes with ideology/hierarchy. You have to accept that structure.

---

**5. MUTUAL AID NETWORKS (urban)**

**Resources:**
- Search: "[your city] mutual aid"
- Post-2020, many formed during COVID
- Food distribution, resource sharing
- People already practicing cooperation

**Warning:** Many are purely crisis response, not building alternatives. But real relationships form.

---

**6. BIOREGIONAL GATHERINGS**

**Resources:**
- Search your bioregion (e.g., "Cascadia bioregional gathering")
- Focus on place-based community
- Often mix indigenous knowledge, permaculture, traditional skills

---

**7. ONLINE SPACES (to find real-world connections)**

**Reddit:**
- r/collapse (doomer, but honest)
- r/collapsesupport
- r/preppers (mixed, but practical)
- r/homesteading
- r/permaculture

**Forums:**
- permies.com (Paul Wheaton's forum)
- survivalistboards.com
- Various homesteading forums

**Discord servers:**
- Deep Adaptation
- Collapse support groups
- Regional organizing

**Warning:** Online is not real. Use it to find in-person. Don't substitute.

---

**8. LAND-BASED PROJECTS SEEKING PEOPLE**

**Resources:**
- **ic.org "communities forming" section**
- **landmatters.org.uk** (UK-based but has connections)
- **goingtoground.com** (people seeking land partners)

**Warning:** Many fail. High idealism, low follow-through. Need legal clarity on land ownership/agreements.

---

## **HOW TO EVALUATE IF PEOPLE ARE REAL:**

**Green flags:**
- Actually doing physical work (not just talking)
- Been at it for years (not just started)
- Have failures/setbacks but persist
- Diverse ages (not just young idealists or old dropouts)
- Clear legal structures (land ownership, agreements)
- Some conflict resolution process (they know people fight)
- Not guru-centered (no charismatic leader)
- Can articulate what HASN'T worked

**Red flags:**
- All talk, no visible work
- Just started, no experience
- Charismatic leader everyone defers to
- No clear agreements (legal or social)
- Can't name conflicts/failures
- Everyone same demographic
- Requires large upfront payment
- Love-bombs newcomers
- Cult vibes

---

## **THE HARD TRUTH ABOUT FINDING PEOPLE:**

**Most attempts fail because:**

1. **People aren't actually ready**
   - Say they are, but can't give up comfort
   - Can't do physical work
   - Leave when it gets hard

2. **Trust takes years to build**
   - Can't rush it
   - Premature commitment fails
   - Need time to see who people really are

3. **Skill mismatch**
   - Need: carpentry, medical, farming, etc.
   - Actually have: 5 web developers

4. **Resource mismatch**
   - Some have land but no money
   - Some have money but no land
   - Some have skills but no capital
   - Hard to align

5. **Life circumstances**
   - Kids in school
   - Aging parents
   - Partners not on board
   - Jobs can't leave
   - Timing never works

6. **Personality conflicts**
   - Even with shared vision
   - Living together is hard
   - Small differences become huge

7. **Legal/financial complexity**
   - Land ownership disputes
   - Who pays for what
   - What if someone leaves
   - Gets ugly fast

---

## **REALISTIC TIMELINE:**

**Not:** Find people this month, start community next month

**More like:**
- Spend 1-2 years visiting places, meeting people
- Spend 6-12 months working somewhere to test yourself and relationships
- Spend 1-2 years building trust with potential co-founders
- Spend 1-2 years acquiring land/resources
- Spend years building the actual thing
- Expect 50%+ to drop out along the way

**You're looking at 5-10 years minimum.**

**Most people aren't willing to commit that time/energy.**

Which is why it doesn't happen.

---

## **ALTERNATIVE APPROACH:**

**Don't try to find perfect people and build utopia.**

**Instead:**

**Start where you are. Build what you can.**

1. **Assess your actual situation:**
   - Where are you physically?
   - What resources do you have?
   - What skills do you have?
   - What constraints (family, money, health)?

2. **Start small and local:**
   - Community garden
   - Tool library
   - Skill shares
   - Mutual aid
   - **Build trust through doing small things together**

3. **Identify who actually shows up:**
   - Who comes consistently?
   - Who does the work?
   - Who can be relied on?
   - **Those are your people**, not the ones who talk big

4. **Deepen gradually:**
   - Don't rush to commune living
   - Build through increasing commitment
   - Let people self-select out

5. **Accept it might be 3-5 people, not 50:**
   - Small resilient group > large fragile one
   - Quality over quantity

---

## **THE BRUTAL REALITY:**

**You might not find 50 people.**

You might find:
- 2-3 people you can really count on
- 10-15 people in loose network
- 30-50 people you know casually

**And that might have to be enough.**

Because waiting for the perfect group means never starting.

**And the clock is running.**

---

## **PRACTICAL FIRST STEPS (actually doable):**

**This week:**
1. Search "intentional communities [your region]"
2. Search "permaculture [your city]"
3. Search "[your city] mutual aid"
4. Join one online forum (permies.com or similar)

**This month:**
1. Attend one in-person gathering
2. Start one small project (garden, skill share)
3. Have coffee with one person who might be thinking similarly

**This year:**
1. Visit 2-3 intentional communities
2. Take a permaculture course or survival skills workshop
3. Start building local relationships through consistent showing up

**Not sexy. Not revolutionary. Just:**
**Actually meeting people in physical space around shared work.**

---

## **THE THING NO ONE WANTS TO HEAR:**

**Finding people requires:**
- Leaving your house
- Going to places
- Talking to strangers
- Being vulnerable
- Trying things that fail
- Persisting anyway
- Years of time

**There's no app for this.**
**No algorithm.**
**No shortcut.**

**It's the slow, hard, embodied work of building trust through shared action.**

**Which is exactly the capacity that tech/convenience destroyed.**

**So finding people requires doing the thing you've been weakened for.**

**Catch-22.**

---

**Does this help? Or is it still too abstract?**

**What's your actual situation - where are you, what constraints do you have, what's actually preventing you from taking step one?**
