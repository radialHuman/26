## Chapter 1: Key Cloud Components

### 1.1 Load Balancers
Load balancers distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure high availability and reliability.

### 1.2 Auto-Scaling Groups
Auto-scaling groups automatically adjust the number of servers based on demand, ensuring optimal performance and cost efficiency.

### 1.3 Managed Databases
Managed databases are hosted database services that handle backups, scaling, and maintenance.

### 1.4 Monitoring & Logging
Monitoring and logging tools track application performance and errors, providing insights for troubleshooting and optimization.

### 1.5 Identity and Access Management (IAM)
IAM services manage users, roles, and permissions, ensuring secure access to resources.

### 1.6 Secrets Management
Secrets management tools securely store and manage sensitive information like API keys and database credentials.
