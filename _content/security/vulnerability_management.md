# Vulnerability Management: Internal Working & Deep Dive

## 1. What is Vulnerability Management?
Vulnerability management is the process of identifying, evaluating, treating, and reporting security vulnerabilities in systems.

## 2. Internal Process
- **Discovery:** Use scanners to find vulnerabilities
- **Assessment:** Prioritize based on risk
- **Remediation:** Patch or mitigate
- **Verification:** Confirm fixes
- **Reporting:** Document and communicate

## 3. Tools
- **Static/Dynamic Analysis:** Scan code and running apps
- **Patch Management:** Automate updates
- **Monitoring:** Detect new threats

## 4. Best Practices
- Regularly scan systems
- Patch promptly
- Educate teams

## 6. Decision-Making Guidance

### When to Use Vulnerability Management
- **Proactive Security:** Essential for organizations aiming to prevent breaches.
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Required to meet standards like GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI-DSS.
- **Complex Environments:** Necessary for systems with multiple dependencies and integrations.
- **Continuous Monitoring Needs:** Ideal for environments requiring real-time threat detection.

### When Not to Use Vulnerability Management
- **Small-Scale Systems:** May be overkill for simple, low-risk setups.
- **Limited Resources:** Not suitable if the organization lacks the budget or expertise.
- **One-Time Assessments:** Use penetration testing instead for isolated evaluations.

### Alternatives
- **Penetration Testing:** For one-time, in-depth security assessments.
- **Managed Security Services:** Outsource to third-party providers.
- **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** For broader threat detection and response.

### How to Decide
1. **Assess Risk Profile:** Determine the criticality of your systems and data.
2. **Evaluate Resources:** Ensure you have the tools and expertise to implement effectively.
3. **Understand Compliance Needs:** Check if regulations mandate vulnerability management.
4. **Start Small:** Begin with high-priority systems and scale as needed.
